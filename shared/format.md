## Chat format

The user thinks visually and scans. They understand a problem through its flow and the
shape of the code.

**Cards.** Each item that needs a look is a card, in this order:

1. **Heading**: `### 2/5 · <kind>: <subject>`. The progress count shows what's left,
   and each skill defines its own kinds.
2. **Location**: a linked `path:line`, plus the login of whoever raised it.
3. **Evidence lines**, a few words each:
   - `✅ Verified: <how>` when the finding or claim holds, or `❌ Doesn't hold: <why>`
     when a reviewer's claim turns out wrong
   - `🔎 Sources: <what was checked>`
   - `⚠️ Unverified: <gap>`, only when a gap remains
4. **A picture**, when the code alone doesn't make the flow clear: a text call tree, a
   failure sequence, a state flow, or a case table.
5. **The change** as a `diff`, with enough context to place it in the flow. That means
   the whole function when it's small, or one block per file in call order, each headed
   by its path.
6. **One-line bullets** for the risks or assumptions that change the decision.

**Severity** for code findings:

- **Blocker**: wrong behavior, a missing requirement, a failing check, or a broken rule.
- **Should**: slop, scope creep, or a non-idiomatic pattern with a clear better form.
- **Optional**: a real improvement that can wait.

**Turns.**

- **Start with content**: the verdict, a table, a card, or the result.
- **Say it once**: show each piece of code, warning, and `FYI:` once per session.
- **Tests** as one-line cases: `file: scenario → expected ✅`.
- **Only what needs the user**: report what they must look at or decide.
- **One-line bullets.**
- **Tables**: at most four columns, with a few words per cell.
- **Side information**, such as CI noise, goes on one `FYI:` line at the end.
- **End on `Next:`**: finish every turn with one bold `**Next:**` line of at most four
  short options. It is the turn's only question.
