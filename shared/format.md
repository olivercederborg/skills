## Chat format

The user thinks visually and scans. They understand a problem through its flow and the
shape of the code.

**Cards.** Each item that needs a look is a card, in this order:

1. **Heading**: `### 2/5 · <kind>: <subject>`. The progress count shows what's left,
   and each skill defines its own kinds.
2. **Location**: who raised it (their login), and a linked `path:line`.
3. **Evidence lines**, a few words each:
   - `✅ Verified: <how>`, or `❌ Doesn't hold: <why>`
   - `🔎 Sources: <what was checked>`
   - `⚠️ Unverified: <gap>`, only when a gap remains
4. **A picture**, when the code alone doesn't make the flow clear: a text call tree, a
   failure sequence, a state flow, or a case table.
5. **The change** as a `diff`, with enough context to place it in the flow. That means
   the whole function when it's small, or one block per file in call order, each headed
   by its path.
6. **At most two one-line bullets** for risks or assumptions.

**Severity** for code findings:

- **Blocker**: wrong behavior, missing scope, a failing check, or a broken rule.
- **Should**: slop, scope creep, or a non-idiomatic pattern with a clear better form.
- **Optional**: a real improvement that can wait.

**Turns.**

- **Start with content**: the verdict, a table, a card, or the result.
- **Once per session**: show each piece of code, warning, and `FYI:` only once. List
  tests as one-line cases: `file: scenario → expected ✅`.
- **Only what needs the user**: report what they must look at or decide.
- **One-line bullets.**
- **Tables**: at most four columns, with a few words per cell.
- **Side information**, such as CI noise, goes on one `FYI:` line at the end.
- **End on `Next:`**: finish every turn with one bold `**Next:**` line of at most four
  short options. It is the turn's only question.
